# Trial_factor_study
 Trial Factor (or Look Else Where) study is used to calculate the 'Global Significance' value for a narrow resonance search in a given mass spectrum. The Maximum likelihood method uses a likelihood ratio method to calculate the local significance value during the fit. This local siginificace exceeds more than 3 sigma value at some mass points even for a null hypothesis. It happens due to the correlation between neighbor mass points. Therefore,  a Trial Factor study is necessary to calculate the true or global significance value before making a claim for an evidence of new physics particle. This package has been used for a CP-odd light Higgs boson Search using BESIII J/psi data (Phys. Rev. D 105, 012008 (2022)).
